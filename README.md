This is my personal blog and website. It has my thoughts about stuff that I've been upto; Which is mostly android, technology, life, coffee, music etc. It's content are in no way affiliated with my employer. 

The site is made with Jekyll and is deployed via Netlify. The theme used is [Hydejack](https://qwtel.com/hydejack/) by Florian Klampfer or [@qwtel](https://twitter.com/qwtel). It's an improvement on the original Hyde theme based on poole. I've made a lot of changes to the HTML, CSS of the theme to suit my needs which helped me to learn about basic front-end.
