Hi. I'm a software engineer mostly working in Android and Java, and this is my blog. 

I pursued my **B.E.** (Major in Information Technology) at **BIT Mesra**, Ranchi, India. Currently, I am an intern at **Samsung R&D Institute Noida** , India and have accepted a job offer from the same. I'm also developing "Musique" music player app in my spare time.

## Recommendations and reviews

These are the things I've enjoyed lately.

**TV Series and Animes**
1. *Stranger things*: A treat for Sci-fi lovers.
2. *The IT Crowd*: For your inner nerd.
3. *Mr. Robot*: For anybody remotely interested in computers.
4. *Black mirror*: Shows how tech can be misused, but watch on your own risk.
5. *Ergo proxy*: An unconventional and eerie anime. I have to admit I read an explanation to understand it completely.
6. *Brooklyn Nine Nine*: Found this through facebook ads, I'm happy that I saw that ad. 

**Games**
1. *Evil Within 2*: A good game. Although I had hilariously horrible performance on my graphic card (It's old).
2. *Horizon Zero Dawn*: Two words - Beautiful graphics (I watched a friend play it).
3. *Witcher 3 - The Wild Hunt*: Best game I've ever played from any perspective - story, gameplay, graphics, music etc. 

**Music**
1. *Trivium*: "The Sin and the Sentence", their latest album, in my opinion, is among their best work with a brilliant combination of melody, screams and drums. Their album "Shogun" is a pretty good place to start listening to them. 
2. *Porcupine tree*: Modern Pink Floyd. "Sound of Muzak" is my favorite track from them. 
3. *Dream Theatre*: Their album "Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory" is a beautiful story told through music and lyrics. The composition of how different instruments go around each other is just amazing. 
4. *In flames*: Underappreceated metal band. Good songs.
5. *Cage the elephant*: "Trouble" and "Ain't No Rest For The Wicked" are very good songs by them.
