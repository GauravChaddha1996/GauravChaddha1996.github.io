excerpt: Reflecting on implementing an imperfectly designed feature in a project and amazing links!
---

While implementing an advanced feature of my project, I learned that I cannot support it as it would break my design and other features. This occurred due to negligence and skipping research work. When I was designing my project, I deemed this feature as too advanced, and didn't recon it's implementation properly which lead to this failure. Fortunately I was able to include it in some other way, but still my perfect initial (or not so perfect) design failed me.   

**What I learned**: *Don't leave any design aspect as todo, and be sure that it's implementation will fit your design. Also, be sure it's implementation won't break time and memory requirements.*

Also, the project is now finally over. I feel, *complete* and satisfied as a dev. So whatever project you are holding back on - just complete it. Release that v1.0, and the rest will follow.
