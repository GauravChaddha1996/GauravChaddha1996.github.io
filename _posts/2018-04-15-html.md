excerpt: Learning HTML/CSS and using them to create a small project - my own startpage.
---

This week I learned **HTML** and **CSS** from [Thinkful](https://thinkful.com) Frontend development course included in Github student pack. I always wanted to have a cool browser startpage, so I went ahead and coded one myself using *HTML/CSS* I had learned. It took me about 5-6 hours to create my first startpage. Here is how it looks.

I also had to deploy a small server to serve the startpage to Firefox because I wanted the link to look better than *"file:///"*. So some quick Google searches lead to a small startup server script. I then use that server's address and port as my home page in Firefox.
